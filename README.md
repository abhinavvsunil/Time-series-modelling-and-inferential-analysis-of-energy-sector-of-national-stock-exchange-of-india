Conducted time series and inferential analysis on 10 years (2014–2024) of NSE Energy Sector stock data, covering 30+ companies, to study volatility, stability, and market behavior.
Engineered technical indicators including returns, RSI (14), MACD, and normalized volume, and quantified uncertainty using Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Confidence Intervals (CI).
Applied K-Means clustering to segment stocks into Strong Movers, Neutral Movers, and Quiet Movers, revealing distinct behavioral and volatility profiles.
Built and compared forecasting models (ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM), with LSTM achieving the lowest RMSE for most firms by capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies.
Performed comparative model evaluation using RMSE and correlation analysis, showing that deep learning outperforms classical models in volatile market conditions, while ARIMA remains reliable for stable stocks.
